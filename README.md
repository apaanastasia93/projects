# Projects repository

### Overall description
The repository contains projects with different problems I worked on such as: Classification; Regression and Time Series. 

### Projects:
1. **Irish rental prices. Dublin’s real estate market short-term
evaluation.** Market fluctuation and lack of information make it difficult for houses’ owners to define appropriate rental prices for their properties. Giving too low or too high prices can affect market demand. Therefore, it’s significantly important to appoint a correct price. In this project we implemented machine learning algorithms to predict properties prices according to their specific characteristics, such as location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, availability of furniture, etc. We compared 4 different models with different outcomes before and after tuning hyperparameters to define the ones with the best performance.
Datasets used for the project was taken mostly from government sources, such as CSO.ie and private rental website daft.ie. 
The problem I was dealing with was regression. In the project the next steps had been performed:

* EDA;
* Dealing with outliers;
* Dealing with missing data;
* Encoding categorical variables;
* Multi correlation;
* Scaling and Feature Importances.

Next Machine Learning algorithms for the regression had been used:

* Random Forest Regressor;
* Ridge Regressor+Polynomial Features;
* KNeighbors Regressor;
* XGB.
